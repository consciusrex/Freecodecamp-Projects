Here is a draft report summarizing the key points from the data exploration and analysis:

# Cardiovascular Disease Data Analysis Report

## Introduction

This report analyzes cardiovascular disease data to identify factors correlated with having cardiovascular disease. The data contains medical information on 70,000 patients including demographics, vital signs, and lab test results. 

## Data Cleaning 

The data was cleaned by removing outliers outside the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles for height and weight. This removed extreme values that could skew the analysis.

## Analysis

The data was analyzed to compare the distribution of key variables between patients with and without cardiovascular disease. 

### Key Findings

- Patients with cardiovascular disease were more likely to have abnormal glucose and cholesterol levels compared to patients without cardiovascular disease.  
- Blood pressure, BMI, and smoking status were also associated with increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
- Age and gender were correlated with cardiovascular disease risk.

### Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix was generated to identify associations between variables. The strongest correlations with cardiovascular disease were:

## Conclusion

In this patient data, abnormal glucose levels, high BMI, smoking, and advanced age had the highest correlations with increased cardiovascular disease risk. These findings can help inform screening and preventive health programs. Further analysis could examine interactions between risk factors and control for potential confounding variables.
